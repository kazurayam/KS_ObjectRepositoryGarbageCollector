== Problem to solve

You can download a Katalon Studio project at https://github.com/kazurayam/ObjectRepositoryGarbageCollection/releases which presents the sample code.

The sample project has a Test Case named link:https://github.com/kazurayam/ObjectRepositoryGarbageCollection/blob/develop/Scripts/main/TC1/Script1677544889443.groovy[Test Cases/main/TC1], which is as follows:

[source, groovy]
----
include::../Scripts/main/TC1/Script1677544889443.groovy[]
----


This script contains lines that contain a fragment `findTestObjcet(...)`.

A call `findTestObject(...)` method refers to a *Test Object*. If you read through the script, you would find that it contains 13 lines with `findTestObject(...)` call. However, if you read it very carefully, you will find that some lines are referring to the same Test Objects. In fact, this script refers to 11 Test objects.

On the other hand, you can look at the `Object Repository` directory in the Katalon Studio GUI. The directory tree would look like this:

image:https://kazurayam.github.io/ObjectRepositoryGarbageCollection/images/1_1_ObjectRepositoryContains15TestObjects.png[Object Repository with 15 Test Objects]

You can find that in the `Object Repository` there are 15 Test Objects defined.

**Problem** : There are 15 Test Objects defined, whereas 11 Test Objects are used by the Test Cases. So 15 minus 11 = 4 Test Cases are not used. In other words, there are 4 garbages. _Can you tell which Test Objects are garbages?_

This sample Katalon Studio project has just 15 Test Objects. It is a small project. I believe that many Katalon users have larger projects with 50 Test Objects, 100, 300, ... possibly even more. The more Test Objects you have, the more garbages you would have.

The unused Test Objects make it difficult to maintain Katalon projects clean and fit. Users will want to remove the garbages. They will want to do that safely with confidence. Therefore they want a tool that provides a list of unused Test Objects.

Unfortunately Katalon Studio does not provide any feature that let us know the list of garbages.
