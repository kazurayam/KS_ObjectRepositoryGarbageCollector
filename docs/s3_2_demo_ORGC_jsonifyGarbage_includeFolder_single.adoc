Script: `Test Cases/demo/ObjectRepositoryGarbageCollector/ORGC_jsonifyGarbage_includeFolder_single`

```
include::assets/Scripts/demo/ObjectRepositoryGarbageCollector/ORGC_jsonifyGarbage_includeFolder_single/Script1745193362971.groovy[]

This script selects Test Objects in a single sub-folder `main/Page_CURA Healthcare Service` in the Object Repository.
