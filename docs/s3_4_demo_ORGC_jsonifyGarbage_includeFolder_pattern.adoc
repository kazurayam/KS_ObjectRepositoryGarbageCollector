=== Example 4: Scanning sub-folders selected by pattern, find unused Test Objects, print the result into a JSON file

Script: `Test Cases/demo/ObjectRepositoryGarbageCollector/ORGC_jsonifyGarbage_includeFolder_pattern`

```
include::assets/Scripts/demo/ObjectRepositoryGarbageCollector/ORGC_jsonifyGarbage_includeFolder_pattern/Script1745193351518.groovy[]
```

This script selects Test Objects in multiple sub-folders in the Object Repository selected by a pattern `"&#42;&#42;/Page_CURA&#42;"`. This pattern matches the following 2 folders:

1. `Object Repository/main/Page_CURA Healthcare Service`
2. `Object Repository/main/Page_CURA Healthcare Service/xtra`

Output:
```
include::assets/testOutput/demo/ObjectRepositoryGarbageCollector/ORGC_jsonifyGarbage_includeFolder_pattern/garbage.json[]
```
