=== Installation

You can download the jar from the [Releases](https://github.com/kazurayam/KS_ObjectRepositoryGarbageCollector/releases) page. Download the `KS_ObjectRepositoryGarbageCollector-x.x.x.jar`; locate it into the `Drivers` folder of your local Katalon Studio project.

In order to confirm if you have the library, open your project in Katalon Studio, open "Project" > "Settings" to check the "Library Management". In the dialog, the jar should be found in the dialog:

=== How to find out unused TestObjects

Here I made a script `Test Cases/ObjectRepositoryGarbageCollector/GC1`:

[source]
----
include::../Scripts/demo/ObjectRepositoryGarbageCollector/GC1/Script1742992081296.groovy[]
----

When I run the script in Katalon Studio, I got the following output in the console:

include::../build/reports/demo/ObjectRepositoryGarbageCollector/GC1.adoc[]

Let me dictate this report.

1. The name of this project is `KS_ObjectRepositoryGarbageCollector``
2. In this project, there are 30 Test Cases in the `Test Cases` folder
3. there are I have 15 Test Objects in the `Object Repository` folder
4. amongst all, there are 4 Test Objects that are not used by any of the Test Cases
5. It to 1.6 seconds to look up the unused Test Objects.

=== How to generate the reverse-reference of TestObjects -> TestCases
