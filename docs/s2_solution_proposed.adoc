=== How to install the library

You can download the jar from the [Releases](https://github.com/kazurayam/KS_ObjectRepositoryGarbageCollector/releases) page. Download the `KS_ObjectRepositoryGarbageCollector-x.x.x.jar`; locate it into the `Driviers` folder of your local Katalon Studio project.

In order to confirm if you have the library, open your project in Katalon Studio, open "Project" > "Settings" to check the "Library Management". In the dialog, the jar should be found in the dialog:

include::../Scripts/demo/ObjectRepositoryGarbageCollector/GC1/Script1742992081296.groovy[]
----

When I run the script in Katalon Studio, I got the following output in the console:
