== step4: Reverse Locators Lookup

=== Test Cases/sampleUse/step4

The injected `ObjectRepository#reverseLookup()` method can look up locators of Test Objects recorded in the Object Repository. It returns a `java.util.Map` object which has the locators as keys, set of Test Object's IDs as values. The result is just the reverse of the result returned by the `list()` method.
