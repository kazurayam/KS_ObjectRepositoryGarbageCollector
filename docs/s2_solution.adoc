== Solution

=== Environment

I developed this project using the following environment:

- macOS Sonoma 14.7.4
- Katalon Studio Free v10.1.0 which bundles JDK17

The KS_ObjectRepositoryGargageCollecor-x.x.x.jar requires Katalon Studio v10 and newer. The jar doesn't run on Katalon Studio v9 and older due to JDK version.

The jar would run on Katalon Runtime Engine, not only on Katalon Studio.

=== Installation

How to get started with the *Object Repository Garbage Collector* in your own Katalon Studio project?

1. Visit the link:https://github.com/kazurayam/KS_ObjectRepositoryGarbageCollector/releases[KS_ObjectRepositoryGarbageCollector, Releases] page. Identify the latest release. Find the `KS_ObjectRepositoryGarbageCollector-x.x.x.jar` attached to each release. Download the jar, save it into the `Drivers` folder of your local Katalon Studio project.
2. Visit the link:https://github.com/kazurayam/MonkDirectoryScanner/releases[MonkDirectoryScanner, Releases] page. Identify the latest release. Find the `MonkDirectoryScanner-x.x.x.jar` attached to each release. Download the jar, save it into the `Drivers` folder of your local Katalon Studio project.
3. Close your project and reopen it so that your Katalon Studio recognize the new jar files.
4. Open the "Project" > "Settings", "Library Management" dialog. Check if two jars are there: image:https://kazurayam.github.io/KS_ObjectRepositoryGarbageCollector/images/2_1_LibraryManagement.png[]
5. You want to create a Test Case to run the *ObjectRepositoryGarbageCollector* class. You can copy & reuse the code link:{PagesURL}/assets/Scripts/demo/ObjectRepositoryGarbageCollector/ORGC_jsonifyGarbage/Script1743835392014.groovy[Test Cases/demo/ObjectRepositoryGarbageCollector/ORGC_jsonifyGarbage]. Thes Test Case should run in any project.
6. You are done! Run the test case and see the output in the console.
