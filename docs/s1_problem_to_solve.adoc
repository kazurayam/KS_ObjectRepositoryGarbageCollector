== Problem to solve

Here is a sample Test Case script named link:https://github.com/kazurayam/ObjectRepositoryGarbageCollection/blob/develop/katalon/Scripts/main/TC1/Script1677544889443.groovy[`Test Cases/main/TC1`] in a Katalon Studio project.

[source, groovy]
----
include::../katalon/Scripts/main/TC1/Script1677544889443.groovy[]
----

This script contains a lot of lines with fragment `findTestObject(...)`. A call `findTestObject(...)` method refers to a *Test Object*. If you read the script, you would find that it contains 13 lines with `findTestObject(...)` call.

Let me show you a screenshot of the `Object Repository` of the Katalon project. The directory tree looks like this:

image:https://kazurayam.github.io/KS_ObjectRepositoryGarbageCollector/images/1_1_ObjectRepositoryContainingUnusedTestObjects.png[Object Repository containing unused Test Objects]

In the `Object Repository` there are 16 Test Objects defined.

Easily we can see that there are some unused Test Objects.

**Problem** : _How can I tell which Test Objects are unused by any of Test Cases? How can I be sure each Test Objects are safe to delete?_

This sample is small; it has only 16 Test Objects. But it is already terrible to to find identify garbage. I believe that many Katalon users have far larger projects with 100 Test Objects, 500, 1000, ... or even more. The more Test Objects you have, it will get worse.

So I developed this library, which will scan a katalon project and identify unused Test Objects quickly.
