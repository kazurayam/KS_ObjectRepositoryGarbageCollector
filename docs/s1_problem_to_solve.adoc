== Problem to solve

Let me start with explaining what problem this library is designed to solve.

I will present a sample Katalon Studio project that has a Test Case named link:https://github.com/kazurayam/ObjectRepositoryGarbageCollection/blob/develop/Scripts/main/TC1/Script1677544889443.groovy[Test Cases/main/TC1]. The script is as follows:

[source, groovy]
----
include::../Scripts/main/TC1/Script1677544889443.groovy[]
----


This script contains lines with fragment `findTestObject(...)`. A call `findTestObject(...)` method refers to a *Test Object*. If you read the script, you would find that it contains 13 lines with `findTestObject(...)` call. However, if you read it carefully, you will find that some lines are referring to the same Test Objects. In fact, this script refers to 11 Test objects.

On the other hand, you can look at the `Object Repository` directory in the Katalon Studio GUI. The directory tree would look like this:

image:https://kazurayam.github.io/ObjectRepositoryGarbageCollection/images/1_1_ObjectRepositoryContains15TestObjects.png[Object Repository with 15 Test Objects]

You can find that in the `Object Repository` there are 15 Test Objects defined.

**Problem** : There are 15 Test Objects defined, whereas 11 Test Objects are used by Test Cases. 15 minus 11 = 4 Test Objects are not used by Test Cases. In other words, there are 4 garbages. _How can you tell which Test Objects are garbages?_

This sample Katalon Studio project has just 15 Test Objects. It is a small project. I believe that many Katalon users have larger projects with 50 Test Objects, 100, 300, ... possibly even more. The more Test Objects you have, the more garbages you would have. The more garbages you have, the more it becomes difficult to find them. _Large scale Katalon Studio projects always contain a lot of garbages_

In order to keep Katalon projects maintainable, users would want to remove the garbages. But they do not want to break their projects. They definitely want a tool that provides a list of unused Test Objects.

_Unfortunately Katalon Studio provides no such tool that shows you a list of unused Test Objects._

Therefore I have developed it.
