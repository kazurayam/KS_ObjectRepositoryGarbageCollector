== Problem to solve

Here is a sample Test Case script named link:https://github.com/kazurayam/ObjectRepositoryGarbageCollection/blob/develop/katalon/Scripts/main/TC1/Script1677544889443.groovy[`Test Cases/main/TC1`] in a Katalon Studio project.

[source, groovy]

include::../katalon/Scripts/main/TC1/Script1677544889443.groovy[]

This script contains 13 statements with a fragment `findTestObject(...)`. Each call `findTestObject(...)` method refers to a specific *Test Object*. Let me show you a screenshot of the `Object Repository` of the Katalon project. The directory tree looks like this:

This small project has 16 Test Objects in the `Object Repository`. Among these, there are several unused Test Objects. I believe that many Katalon users have larger projects with 100 Test Objects, 500 or even more. The "Web Recording" tool generates a lot of Test Objects. The generated set of Test Objects contains a lot of duplications. The tool tends to make your project cluttered.

Now I want to tidy up my Katalon project, but ...

**Problem** : _How can I tell which Test Objects are unused by any of Test Cases? How can I tell duplicating Test Objects with same locators (XPath expression, CSS selectors)?  How can I be sure which Test Objects are safe to delete?_

So I developed the `ObjectRepositoryGarbageCollector`. This will scan a Katalon project, analyze the "Test Cases" and "Object Repository" folder, and inform you of unused Test Objects quickly.
