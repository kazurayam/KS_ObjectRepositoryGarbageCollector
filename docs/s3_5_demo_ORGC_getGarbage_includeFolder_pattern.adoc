=== Example 5: Scanning sub-folders selected by pattern, find unused Test Objects, get the result as `Garbage` instance, use it as you like

Script: `Test Cases/demo/ObjectRepositoryGarbageCollector/ORGC_getGarbage_includeFolder_pattern`

```
include::assets/Scripts/demo/ObjectRepositoryGarbageCollector/ORGC_getGarbage_includeFolder_pattern/Script1745194432677.groovy[]
```

This script receives an instance of `Garbage` object which contains the data reported by the `ObjectRepositoryGarbageCollector`. The script calls the link:{PagesURL}/api/com/kazurayam/ks/testobject/gc/Garbage.html[Garbage class API].

Output:
```
include::assets/consoleOutput/demo/ObjectRepositoryGarbageCollector/ORGC_getGarbage_includeFolder_pattern/output.txt[]
```
